# Education App
 This project is a mobile application built with Flutter using Clean Architecture, TDD, and Firebase. Clean Architecture ensures well-structured, modular, and maintainable code. TDD is implemented to ensure each feature is tested from the beginning, enhancing quality and reducing bugs. Firebase is used for user authentication and real-time data synchronization. The result is a high-performance, scalable application ready for further development.
